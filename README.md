**Cloud-Native Visionary | Context-Driven Systems Thinker | Creator of Stone.js**

---

## Welcome to my digital workspace.

I'm the creator of **Stone.js**, a universal JavaScript/TypeScript framework that redefines application design through the **Continuum Architecture**, an architecture I also authored in the **Continuum Manifesto**.

I'm not just writing code.  
I'm building systems that adapt to their context, scalable, portable, cost-effective by design.

## What I Do

### Creator of [Stone.js](https://stonejs.com)  
A universal, cloud-native friendly JavaScript/TypeScript framework where **execution context is not hardcoded, but resolved at runtime**.  
Stone.js lets you write logic once and defer environment-specific behavior, deployable on Node.js, browsers, or FaaS with zero rewrite.

### Author of the [Continuum Architecture Manifesto](https://evens-stone.github.io/continuum-manifesto/)  
A new vision for software architecture: delay context decisions to runtime, reduce coupling, and design systems to embrace uncertainty.

### Founder of the **Stone Foundation**  
A non-profit organization that:
- Promotes the Stone.js ecosystem
- Guides companies toward modern cloud-native architectures
- Shares best practices for efficient, scalable, cost-effective systems
- Helps teams rethink the software development lifecycle with modern tooling and philosophy

## Philosophy

‚ÄúArchitecture is no longer the art of building systems in certainty.
It is the art of designing for the unknown, where context unfolds, not upfront, but in the moment.
In this new era, logic waits. Meaning emerges. And software becomes an act of presence.‚Äù
-- Pierre Evens, Continuum Manifesto
