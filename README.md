**Cloud-Native Visionary | Context-Driven Systems Thinker | Creator of Stone.js**

---

## Welcome to my digital workspace

I'm the creator of **Stone.js**, a universal JavaScript/TypeScript framework that redefines application design through the **Continuum Architecture**, an architecture I also authored in the **Continuum Manifesto**.

I'm not just writing code.  
I'm building systems that adapt to their context, scalable, portable, cost-effective by design.

## What I Do

### Creator of [Stone.js](https://stonejs.com)  
A universal, cloud-native friendly JavaScript/TypeScript framework where **execution context is not hardcoded, but resolved at runtime**.  
Stone.js lets you write logic once and defer environment-specific behavior, deployable on Node.js, browsers, or FaaS with zero rewrite.

### Author of the [Continuum Architecture Manifesto](https://evens-stone.github.io/continuum-manifesto/)  
A new vision for software architecture: delay context decisions to runtime, reduce coupling, and design systems to embrace uncertainty.

### Founder of the **Stone Foundation**  
A non-profit organization that:
- Promotes the Stone.js ecosystem
- Guides companies toward modern cloud-native architectures
- Shares best practices for efficient, scalable, cost-effective systems
- Helps teams rethink the software development lifecycle with modern tooling and philosophy

## Projects

### 🧱 Core Framework

* 🧱 [**Stone.js**](https://github.com/stonemjs/stone) – The next-generation JavaScript/TypeScript framework designed around Continuum Architecture. Write once, run anywhere: backend, frontend, edge, FaaS.

### ⚙️ Tooling & Developer Experience

* ⚙️ [**Stone CLI**](https://github.com/stonemjs/cli) – Unified CLI for building, testing, bundling, and scaffolding Stone.js applications.

### 🚦 Routing & Runtime

* 🚦 [**Stone Router**](https://github.com/stonemjs/router) – Universal router for backend and frontend applications, SSR-ready, middleware-first.

### ⚛️ View Integrations

* ⚛️ [**Stone React**](https://github.com/stonemjs/use-react) – First-class React support for Stone.js, including SSR, hydration, head management, and DOM injection.

### 🔌 Adapters & Integration

* 🧩 [**Stone Adapters**](https://github.com/stonemjs/node-http-adapter) – Run Stone.js on Node.js, AWS Lambda, or any custom runtime with powerful adapter system.

### 📘 Documentation & Philosophy

* 📘 [**Stone Documentation**](https://github.com/stonemjs/docs) – Official docs for all things Stone.js, including examples, guides, and API reference.
* 🧭 [**Continuum Manifesto**](https://github.com/evens-stone/continuum-manifesto) – The architectural foundation and philosophy behind Stone.js and the Continuum mindset.

## Philosophy

“Architecture is no longer the art of building systems in certainty.  
It is the art of designing for the unknown, where context unfolds, not upfront, but in the moment.  
In this new era, logic waits. Meaning emerges. And software becomes an act of presence.”  
- Pierre Evens, Continuum Manifesto
